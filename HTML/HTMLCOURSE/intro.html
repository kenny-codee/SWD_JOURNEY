        In 2021 and 2022, Karen Levy and I taught a new course entitled Choices
        and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is
        designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and
        covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of
        computing and information.
