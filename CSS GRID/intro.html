the default view of a grid is taking up the full width but using the content to determine the height
grid have a shorthand for combining the rows and column
grid-template: 100px 150px/ 200px 300px
auto column takes up the remaining width of the browser but rows just take the height content
Also more responsive in grid is using the minmax(min max)
Another shorthand in writing fractional unit in grid is using the repeat patern repeat(2, 200px)

layout in grid - we can use the span, the column start and end to chnage where the grid is in.
